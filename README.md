Installing
==========

 1. Get cocos2d-x (v3.3) from their git repo and follow their readme
 2. Follow the example and make new custom project
 3. Copy the cocos2d folder from the example's root to the root of this project
 4. Get the [POCO C++](http://pocoproject.org/) library (compile, add headers to include path)
   1. Compile POCO for the platform you will build
   2. Move POCO lib files to libs/<PLATFORM>
 5. Build

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

For Windows 8.1 build - both WinRT and Windows Phone 8.1 need cocos2d-x development version from github directly !!!
(We depend on still not released code)
